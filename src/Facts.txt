The trail followed three main rivers: the Platte, the Snake and the Columbia.

The trail is not actually a single path. In some places along the route there might have been parallel routes.

The Oregon and California Trails followed the same path until either Fort Bridger in Wyoming or Soda Springs or the Raft River in Idaho where they split up.

Independence, Missouri was the original starting point of the trail until outfitters began setting up shop further north and west in St. Joseph, Missouri.

Later in the trail's history, John McLoughlin's general store in Oregon City was considered the last stop on the trail.

The Sublette Cutoff in Wyoming was a shortcut that shortened the trail by 70 miles! However, there was limited access to water on this shortcut.

Barlow Road was constructed in 1846 to give pioneers a land option that allowed them to avoid having to navigate the rapids on the Columbia River.

The trail went through six different states: Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho and Oregon.

1843 was the year of the first major migration where historians estimate a single wagon train of 120 wagons and around 500 people travelled the trail.
